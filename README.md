    <h1>üìù Notes App</h1>
    <h4>After a semester-long journey with iOS Academy in the App Team, I rebuilt a simple yet powerful iOS note-taking application as it's the most-frequently-used app in my daily life. It allows users to create, edit, and manage notes across multiple folders just like Apple's Notes App.</h4>
